# sms_spam_detection

This repo contains the code for a simple web page that is used to present an sms spam prediction model. Submitting the form triggers a lambda function which classifies the input message as spam or ham (non-spam). The results are saved in a dynamoDB table.

The following google colab link contains the code for the sms spam prediction model: https://colab.research.google.com/github/owenmccadden/comp_421/blob/main/final/421_final.ipynb
